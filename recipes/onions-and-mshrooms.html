            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut onions into thin slices and mushrooms into thicker slices.</li>
            <li>Heat up at Skillet on medium low heat. stainless steel or cast 
                is best.</li>
            <li>Once pan has heated up 10-15mins put 2 TBS of butter in pan and
                add in onions. Stir frequently and often after about 10mins when
                onions become translucent salt heavily kosher is best about 1-2TBS</li>
            <li>After another 5-10mins add in mushrooms. You&rsquo;ll notice theres
                a lot of water when they start cooking down be patient if you can&rsquo;t
                turn up the heat to medium high and leave small circle of room on bottom of
                pan you should be able to see the bottom.</li>
            <li>When you see the onions and mushrooms look like mush thats perfect add some 
                pepper and 2TBS of soy sauce to deglaze the pan and they&rsquo;ll come up.</li>
            <li>They are ready to serve on your favorite meat or veggie</li>
